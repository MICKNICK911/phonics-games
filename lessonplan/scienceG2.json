Students learn to differentiate organisms from inanimate objects through observable characteristics and life processes.\n\n## Characteristics of Living Things\nDefining features of organisms:\n# [Living things] can:\n- Move by themselves: Self-propelled motion (animals walk, plants grow toward light)\n- Grow and change: Developmental transformations (seed to plant, child to adult)\n- Reproduce (make babies): Biological continuity (animals bear young, plants produce seeds)\n- Need food and water: Metabolic requirements for energy and function\n- Breathe: Gas exchange processes (respiration in animals, photosynthesis in plants)\n\n## Characteristics of Non-Living Things\nAttributes of inanimate objects:\n# [Non-living things] cannot:\n- Grow or change by themselves: Require external forces for alteration\n- Reproduce: Lack biological replication mechanisms\n- Need food: No metabolic processes\n_Examples: stones, water, books_",
